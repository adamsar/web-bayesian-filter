Old Guy Who Refused To Shave Till The Vikings Won A Super Bowl Dies On Jan. 12, 1975, the Minnesota Vikings lost Super Bowl IX, their third Super Bowl defeat in six seasons. That very day, Vikings fan Emmett John Pearson vowed not to shave his beard till the team broke through and won a title. He did just that for the next 38 years, his long, unruly white beard becoming his trademark. Pearson died Monday at the age of 83, his ability to keep a promise outlasted by the Vikings' capacity to disappoint their fans. Read more...

Man with testicles and a mustache coming through!").* "Dude" contains multitudes; it rolls off the brain like water; I wield it with instinct, not thought, like an appendage. Read more...

TMZ believes this could perhaps kinda sorta be an indication that Dan Snyder is possibly maybe plotting to change his team's nickname. But there are still a lot of dots here with not much to connect them. And since TMZ published its initial story, the 'Skins have denied that any of this has anything to do with them. Read more...

New Nail Salon for Men Is the Manliest Place on Earth As everyone who has ever seen a television commercial knows, one does not simply use a gendered product that's been assigned to the other gender. One must wait until a marketing team devises a gender-appropriate version, and then rush out and throw money at it. This is why we have steak houses for women and why we have brogurt, which is yogurt for men. Because of this age-old tradition, men have been waiting since the dawn of time to get manis and pedis — and now, finally, the prayers that they made by clasping together their gnarled and ungroomed cuticles have been answered.
