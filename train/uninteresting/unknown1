Magda I was on the subway a few months ago when I noticed a gorgeous woman sitting next to me with flowers and butterflies in her hair. The subway car was too cramped to get a proper photo and my stop was quickly approaching. I handed the woman my card in hopes that we would meet again. We finally met up a few days ago in her stunning apartment near Central Park. Magda was even more breathtaking than I had remembered. As she was putting her signature flowers in her hair she told me "My life is colors, always full of colors." Stay tuned for more pictures from my wonderful afternoon with Magda next week.

Whether she's making hats out of paper towels, or turning a pillowcase into a hat (like in the photos above) you can always count on Debra for some style inspiration. The other day I caught her in the middle of making some of her famous " Viva Paper Towel Hats," so I whipped out my iPhone and made the short video below. Hope you enjoy Debra's wonderful tips and I can't way to see everyone's creations...

How To Deal With Pain I created Advanced Style to start a dialogue about aging and to show a
 positive and uplifting image of getting older. It's equally important 
to show how older people confront the struggles and difficulties that 
accompany the aging process. Artist, Ilona Royce Smithkin lifts the 
spirits of everyone around her. She was kind enough to share some 
incredible insight into how she deals with physical pain. We can all 
learn from her inspiring words below: 
 
 Everyday 
something unexpected happens to our bodies. I fight everyday to get up 
and out of bed.When I feel a pain somewhere I tell my body, "I'm so nice
 to you, what do you want from me?" And I tell myself a little story or 
joke and remind myself of the times when I was in worse pain, and how 
lucky I am today, and the pain begins to go away. I tell myself that 
this isn't the first time, or the last time that I will feel pain and begin to occupy my mind with other things. You must get involved in things
 outside of the pain, things that give you interest. All these things 
are a part of life. We all feel pain and unpleasantness. As long as I
 can seduce myself to enjoy all kinds of things, like in the morning 
enjoying the first cup of coffee, or piece of chocolate the pain begins 
to diminish. I give myself nice things to look forward to, throughout 
the day. The moment you give in and let yourself get dragged down by 
misery you are closer to death.

Two years ago, I photographed my dear friend Lucy Jarvis on Madison Avenue, wearing the most incredible Robot Ring. I ended up putting the photo in my book and have been dreaming about it ever since. My dreams came true last week, when I finally met up with Mia Fonssagrives-Solow, designer of the robot ring and many other incredible pieces of jewelry and sculpture. I decided to splurge and purchase a ring from Mia and haven't taken it off since. Check out Mia's work HERE . There are still a few robot rings around!!!

My Mom I just got back from Italy where my family celebrated my parent's 41st Anniversary. I took this picture of my gorgeous 65-year-old mom in Capri! My mom taught me to respect and appreciate older people at a very early age. It is because of her and my grandmothers that I started this project and I will be forever thankful for their love and support.

Theresa, Madrid, NM A few weeks ago I traveled to New Mexico for a couple of days to meet my friends Orren and Rob . On my way through Madrid, New Mexico I met Theresa, a local who has been living in the town for over 40 years. Theresa told us about our gorgeous surroundings and some history about the historic mining towns nearby. If you get a chance to visit New Mexico, I highly recommend a drive along the Turquoise Trail and a stop for lunch in Madrid.
