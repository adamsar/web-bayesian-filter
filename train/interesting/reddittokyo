Tokyo Tomorrow One Day Alone Tomorrow I will be in Tokyo by myself and I'm wondering what to do. I am female originally from USA but have been living in Seoul, Korea for the last year. I'm visiting a friend in Tokyo. However, my flight lands at Narita at 11am, and my friend doesn't finish work until 7:30pm. So I have an afternoon to kill. Any suggestions for places to see/stuff to do? Or anyone free and want to show me around? submitted by Wanderlustisit  [link] [5 comments]

Where to buy a Japanese Mahjong set with larger tiles in Tokyo (x-post from /r/Mahjong) Kunichiwa Tokyo Redditors- This is a cross post from /r/mahjong . I'll be going to Tokyo, Japan in a couple of weeks and I want to know where I can purchase a nice Japanese Riichi mahjong set with much larger size tiles (larger than the ones that are 1 inch in height), similar to the ones pictured in pic1 and pic2 . The tiles in these images are part of the Tenho set from the Japanese Games Shop . Last year, I went to the store locations listed by Sloperama -- Okuno Karutaten and the Hakuhinkan Toy Park and so far I've seen sets with tiles 1 inch in height. Does anyone know of places in Tokyo where they specialize in selling primarily Japanese Riichi mahjong sets with different sizes and styles? Thanks in advance! submitted by Happy_Sparrow  [link] [1 comment]

/r/Tokyo meetup: 4pm on Sunday 3rd November, "Stand T" dining bar near Tokyo station. Details inside! Hey all, A couple of weeks ago I made a topic asking if anyone would be interested in meeting up for food and drinks during the time I'll be in Tokyo. We got a lot of positive responses, and with the help of /u/arishaintokyo , we've picked a place.   I did a quick search of some easy to find pay-as-you-go places so nobody has to worry about splitting the bill. This seems like it might be a good option:   Tabelog (in Japanese )  Gurunavi (in Japanese, some English on the menu)   It's called &quot;Stand T&quot;, a cheap &quot;dining bar&quot; with basic beers, cocktails, and food on the menu. It's right outside the newly renovated Tokyo station.  ( full post )  I picked the time of 4pm so we can meet and eat, and then if we feel like it we can head off to have drinks or go explore the city as a group. The place itself turns into a bar after 5pm so if we feel lazy we can just stay on there. Closer to the date I expect we will have a much more detailed itinerary so we can say that at 4pm we'll be here, at 7pm we'll be somewhere else, so people can drop in and drop out as they want to. So, the details:  Time : 4pm on Sunday, 3rd November  Location : Stand-T dining bar near Tokyo station ( MAP )  Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions, and reply in the topic if you're interested. I don't mind if its three people or a hundred people, it'll be a good time. Also, it's a self-post so I get no karma, so please drop an upvote on the topic for visibility, even if you can't make it. See you there :) submitted by chimpwithalimp  [link] [28 comments]

Melon Fanta (ファンタメロン) I've been looking for ファンタメロン ever since I tried it in a restaurant in Odaiba but have been unable to find it in larger quantities outside of restaurants. Are there any supermarkets or smaller shops in Tokyo / Yokohama area that sells them (or something similar)? submitted by Zerbruz  [link] [11 comments]

Can anyone recommended (or possibly a redditor?) a place to stay for a week or so? Hostels or? I've found a few places that seem trustworthy by searching past threads; such as Sakura hostel, 24 hour internet cafes by sleeping in your chair and Nui Hostel. What would you guys recommended? submitted by careago_  [link] [6 comments]

Is there any Halloween parties after the 28th...? I have an important test back home the 26th, but I had the opportunity to take the test next year. I told my friends that I really wanted to celebrate halloween in Japan (I love halloween in general) and asked if it was OK that I came to Japan on the 28th instead, of if I would miss everything. Everyone told me that &quot;No there is things happening the whole week, no worries&quot;. After I realized that all facebook events I've gotten invited to is on the 26th, I asked around again, and suddenly the answer I got from everyone was &quot;No sorry, probably no events happening after the 26th....&quot;. I get really sad by this since I really was looking forward to Halloween in Tokyo, is this true? I mean, Halloween isn't until the 31th. I don't understand why people celebrate this weekend and next but not the one that comes straight after it, or on the particular day of Halloween. submitted by horseniss  [link] [8 comments]

American Thanksgiving in Tokyo: Getting a Turkey Delivered So I'm setting up a Thanksgiving feast for some friends, and we've decided to have it at a nearby park. Now, optimally I would bake the turkey in my own oven, but this is Japan and my oven wouldn't fit a whole chicken, much less a 15lbs behemoth. In the past I've heard of places in Tokyo that can deliver cooked turkey; does anyone know where that might be? National Azabu might work, but I'm out of their delivery area. TL;DR How can I get a cooked turkey delivered for Thanksgiving? submitted by fencerJP  [link] [5 comments]

Art/Graphic Design/Fun in Tokyo Hello Everyone, so I just booked a trip out to Tokyo on a whim, I arrive Oct. 29 and leave Nov. 5. I know very little about Tokyo so if anyone has some easy suggestions of things that would be criminal to miss please fill me in. I am from California and I am a graphic designer so I am extremely interested in all things art/design related. Aside from that I am interested in hikes, food, drinking, music, the usual irresponsible 25 yr old stuff. I will be traveling alone. As of now i haven't booked a place to stay so any suggestions on a good area would be greatly appreciated. How are the Tokyo hostels? Also, if anyone wants to meet up for drinks, food, a night out, or some art museums, I'm game for anything. OH! I almost forgot, I will be there for halloween, what he hell should I do!? submitted by ESEE  [link] [21 comments]
