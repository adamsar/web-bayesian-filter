I hope this question belongs here. What is the best exclusive - (I mean focusing on Japanese subtitles) - resource online which has Japanese subtitles of popular English television programs? I only ask because I was recently looking for subtitles for season 1 - 7 of 'The Big Bang Theory' and could only find a few links. After googling for a long time I could not easily find what I was looking for. Honestly, I would prefer a site that would link to hardsub torrent files which I could directly download onto my computer. Anyway, just thought I would ask. submitted by hiddenbeardfist  [link] [3 comments]

Classical Music(Western) in Japan Not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question. I have seen many excellent Japanese players who are well versed in what some people in Europe and the Americas call &quot;classical&quot; music and I'm left wondering how a Japanese person learns to read western music. Do they have to first learn at least a portion of the Roman alphabet, do they re-asign japanese characters to the notes of the 12 tone scale, or is there something entirely different? Also, how are the historical greats of western music; Brahms, Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart, ect. viewed in Japan? submitted by sgriffin4  [link] [5 comments]

Questions about the Tokio Hot 100 I look at the results every week, but I've got a few questions about how it works. I hope someone can help. What makes a song chart on it? Does airplay on J-Wave count (/is it the only thing that counts?), do any sort of downloads count, etc? I know that you can vote on songs that are currently charting, but how do songs debut on it? To those who don't know what I'm talking about, here's the link: http://www.j-wave.co.jp/original/tokiohot100/chart/ Thanks! submitted by CrashingForeignCars  [link] [3 comments]

Looking for affordable, traditional Ryokans in Japan Hello fellow Japan-heads! So I will be traveling around the world soon, and my most anticipated stop will be in Japan! I wanted to have a stay at a traditional Ryokan at leas for a couple nights, but also don't want to let my wallet hemorrhage too much, as I will still be traveling after leaving JP. So I was wondering if anyone here has any suggestions or recommendations on finding a great traditional experience?? (ideally between Tokyo and Kyoto) (also, yes, I have been searching around on my own, but just can't find &quot;the one&quot; yet) Thank you everyone! submitted by LOCDAR  [link] [3 comments]

Ca someone recommend a laptop repair service near Yokosuka? Due to some poorly constructed furniture, my laptop had a cracked area in the upper-right heand corner of the screen. I'd like to see if there any reapair shops that can look at it and possibly replace the LCD screen, saving me some cash. Portability is necessary, so hooking it up to a monitor is out of the question, and I don't want to spend too much money if I can help it so replacing it is not something that I want to do. I'm in the Yokosuka area and will be staying here for a while, so I have no problem with a wait time for repairs. submitted by Aeon_Chaosfire  [link] [comment]

Taking a Softbank iPhone on holiday to the US I did a search and didn't find exactly what I'm looking for. I know that SB offers international roaming, but it seems they've increased the fee to Y3000/day (if you go over the laughable 25MB limit). Does anyone know of a viable and cheaper alternative that's available in the States? Portable wifi, or something like that? The phone is locked, so other SIM cards are not an option... Edit: This was the top hit on google for &quot;portable wifi rental&quot;. $12.95/day.  http://mobilewifi.telecomsquare.us/mobile-wifi-mifi-hotspot-rental-service-plans.aspx#usa Are these guys legit? submitted by hai_dozo  [link] [8 comments]

Job searching in Japan (non-English teaching) My wife and I have just recently moved to Japan (Kyoto) and she is currently looking for a job with little success. She is Japanese-American but has never lived in Japan before. She's been really down about her lack of progress on this, and I really want to help her, but have no experience with looking for jobs other than English teaching. Because she looks Japanese, but her vocabulary is limited, she often runs into road blocks as people don't give her the same consideration as &quot;regular foreigners.&quot; I'm really not sure where else to look... Her conversational Japanese (written, spoken, and reading) is native level, but she has problems with keigo and vocabulary used in official situations. She's working on it by studying though, and I think in a few months she'll be up to speed. She was hoping to find a job that is not English language teaching, and her last few jobs in America was doing administrative work at social work companies. Ideally she would like to continue something like that here, but she is open to other fields. I'm not really sure what else to do besides basic internet searches...Any information on resources for job searching or any job searching companies would be sincerely appreciated!! Thank you!! submitted by harapekopeko  [link] [10 comments]

My favorite 100円 glasses broke :( When I was living in Japan, I bought some cute little fruit glasses from the 100円 store. I had 4- two strawberry, one lemon, and one apple. Those were the only fruits I saw. They have little English blurbs on them. Recently, one strawberry and the apply cup broke D: I am so sad! Here is a picture of all three glasses. If any of you see these glasses at any 100円 stores, will you grab some for me? I will pay for the glasses and the shipping to the US. I'd also be interested in other fruits, but want to stick to a matching theme. Thank yoooooou :3 submitted by bunnyish  [link] [5 comments]

What do you think is the best means to control TEPCO? Personally I feel that its just rinse and repeat of them saying "oops, it leaked" each time without significant repercussions. Personally I love Japan, so I am really saddened by this behaviour. I hope someone can come up with some good ideas. submitted by xerithakyn  [link] [comment]

Why is Ayase Haruka even popular in Japan? She's not pretty, but then again, who would you consider the prettiest actress in Japan? Honestly, although I love Japanese culture, I can't seem to pinpoint who you could call prettiest so I need some help. submitted by xerithakyn  [link] [10 comments]
